            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Fashion_Week" target="_blank">NYFW</a> can be both amazingly fun & incredibly overwhelming, especially if you have never been. Luckily, I'm here to give you an insider's guide and make your first show a pleasurable experience. By taking my tips and tricks, and following your gut, you'll have an unforgettable experience!

        <h2>Getting Tickets & Picking the Shows</h2>

            If you are lucky or connected you can get an invite, sans the price tag. But I wasn't so luck or connected my first two years, so I'm here to help you out. First, plan out which shows are most important to you and make a schedule and this is a biggie: SET A BUDGET.
            <br>
            If you are worried about blowing your cash the whole time you won't have fun. Then check out prices, days, and time and prioritize the designers you want to see most. Lastly, purchase your tickets and get excited!

        <h2>Dressing for the Shows</h2>

            Always be true to your own sense of style, if you don't you'll be uncomfortable the whole time and it'll show. Remember, NYFW, is about expressing yourself and taking in what the designers have chosen to express through their new lines.
            <br>
            Also, it's important to wear shoes you'll be comfortable in all day. Obviously you want to look good, but you'll be  on your feet all day long, so be prepared.
