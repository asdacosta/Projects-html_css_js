        <h2>1 INTRODUCTION</h2>

        <h3>1.1 Background</h3>
        <p>
            The application of college curriculum in practical environments has been a significant and widely discussed topic in the field of education. Prominent figures such as Elon Musk have expressed their views on the value of college education, with statements like "You don't need college to learn." Some successful individuals, including Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg, chose to drop out of college to focus on gaining practical knowledge and applying it to their various endeavors. As the gap between theoretical knowledge and real-world application continues to be a challenge for students, it becomes essential to examine how effectively college curriculum prepares individuals for the practical demands they will encounter in their professional lives. This chapter provides a comprehensive background on examining the utilization of college curriculum in practical environments. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Universities prioritize the teaching of theories due to their long-standing adherence to traditional practices. Their main emphasis is on publishing research, and their ranking is determined by the quantity of research papers they produce rather than the practical skills imparted to students. Consequently, this selfish motivation leads to a greater emphasis on theoretical knowledge. Lecturers and professors are evaluated and dismissed based on their academic accomplishments rather than their capacity to prepare students for practical job skills. These factors contribute to the perpetuation of the traditional culture of theory-based education in universities. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The acquisition of knowledge and skills in college courses serves as the foundation for individuals' future careers and professional growth. However, the mere acquisition of theoretical knowledge may not suffice in preparing individuals to effectively apply what they have learned in practical settings. There is a growing recognition that the ability to apply college curriculum in real-world contexts is crucial for successful professional performance and career advancement. Therefore, understanding the extent to which college curriculum is utilized in practical environments is vital for improving the educational experience and ensuring its relevance and effectiveness.  
        </p>
        <p>
            In all organizations, the focus is on what an employee can do in their job, rather than just what they know. This emphasizes the importance of applying knowledge in practical situations, rather than simply possessing theoretical knowledge. The world is filled with numerous theories, but not all of them can be put into practice. However, universities often present students with a multitude of both validated and invalidated theories to learn. Thereâ€™s no point in learning a lot of things because the students never use them in the future. In the context of learning and memorization, individuals often rely on memorizing concepts due to time constraints associated with exams. This observation is based on personal experiences and feedback from colleagues. As a result, our focus becomes learning or memorizing for the purpose of passing exams rather than truly understanding the material. Understanding the meaning of a concept is one thing, but being able to apply that concept in real-world scenarios is an entirely different challenge. In the real world, individuals either work for established organizations or establish their own businesses. In both cases, the key requirement is the ability to apply knowledge and skills rather than solely relying on theoretical understanding. 
        </p>
        <p>
            In conducting research, theories are often employed to make new discoveries. However, approved theories are used, and it is important to have a clear understanding of where and how they are applied in the field the research is being conducted. The challenge lies in bridging the gap between theory and practical fields to effectively utilize theories in real-world contexts. The theories themselves are not directly connected to the practical fields, which presents a hurdle in harnessing their full potential in those fields. 
        </p>
        <p>
            In today's dynamic and competitive job market, employers increasingly seek candidates who possess both academic qualifications and practical skills. They expect graduates to seamlessly transition from the classroom to the workplace, ready to apply their knowledge and contribute meaningfully to their organizations. The utilization of college curriculum in practical environments directly impacts graduates' employability and their ability to meet the expectations of employers. However, this is not the case as the graduates only possess academic qualifications. 
        </p>

                    Within these discussions, the perspectives of different stakeholders come to the forefront. Most students express their perception that the courses they undertake in university often feel disconnected from practical applications in the work field, rendering them somewhat useless. Conversely, approximately half of educators acknowledge the value of these courses, asserting that they provide a foundational understanding that can be applied in professional settings. On the other hand, employees from diverse industries assert that university courses are nearly inconsequential in the work field, as they argue that different skill sets and qualifications are required to thrive in practical environments.

                    Interestingly, employers from larger agencies and organizations hold a distinct viewpoint. They emphasize that while academic credentials play a role, practical experience and demonstrated abilities hold greater weight in their hiring decisions. Consequently, these employers tend to prioritize candidates who possess hands-on experience, thereby devaluing the theoretical coursework undertaken by students in academic settings. In contrast, employers from smaller companies present a more nuanced perspective. Approximately half of them contend that graduate students perform well in the workplace and meet expectations, implying that the university curriculum plays a significant role in equipping students with the necessary skills.

            <h3>5.1 Introduction</h3>
            <p>
                The study aimed to investigate the extent to which college curriculum is applied in real-world settings and identify the factors that facilitate or hinder its application. Additionally, it aimed to explore the impact of practical application on students' professional performance and career development. This section presents a summary of the key findings, followed by the conclusion, recommendations, and the contributions of the study. 
            </p>
            <h3>5.2 Summary of Findings</h3>
            <p>
                These are the key findings:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Effectiveness of College Curriculum Application: The research findings indicate that the application of college curriculum in real-world practical settings varies across different stakeholder groups. Students perceive the curriculum as moderately useful, while educators believe it to be more useful in the work field. However, employees and employers express a more critical view, considering it as relatively useless in practical environments. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Factors Facilitating Application: Several factors were identified as facilitating the application of college curriculum in practical environments. These include a strong alignment between theoretical concepts and practical skills, effective instructional methodologies, active collaboration between academia and industry, and opportunities for experiential learning and internships. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Factors Hindering Application: The study also identified several factors that hinder the application of college curriculum in practical environments. These include a lack of updated and industry-relevant curriculum, limited integration of real-world scenarios and projects, inadequate training and professional development for educators, and a gap between academic requirements and industry demands. Another obstacle to students applying university education in the real world is the practice of punishing students for making mistakes, which discourages them from taking risks, approaching new problems, and making bold decisions in professional settings. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Impact on Students' Professional Performance: The findings suggest that practical application of college curriculum positively influences students' professional performance and career development. Students who have opportunities for hands-on experiences and internships tend to develop stronger practical skills, adaptability, and problem-solving abilities, enhancing their employability in the job market. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Enhancement of educational institutions: The study found that integrating real-world experiences and practical applications in the college curriculum, fostering industry partnerships, and adopting learner-centered instructional methods enhance the relevance and effectiveness of college curriculum in preparing students for practical challenges and demands. University education can also be enhanced by promoting the understanding that problems can have multiple solutions. Encouraging students to consider different perspectives and think creatively when faced with challenges allows for a broader range of solutions to be explored, moving beyond a narrow focus on a single solution as it is the case in the university, specifically in examinations. This will enable the students to fit in the practical environment that presents problems which require different ways of solving them. 
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>5.3 Conclusion</h3>
            <p>
                Based on the research findings, it can be concluded that while college curriculum has some level of utility in practical environments, there is a need for further improvement and alignment with industry demands. The study highlights the importance of bridging the gap between academia and industry, updating curriculum content, enhancing instructional methodologies, and promoting experiential learning opportunities.
