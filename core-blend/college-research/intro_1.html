        <h3 id="intro1">1.1 Background</h3>
        <p>
            The application of college curriculum in practical environments has been a significant and widely discussed topic in the field of education. Prominent figures such as Elon Musk have expressed their views on the value of college education, with statements like "You don't need college to learn." Some successful individuals, including Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg, chose to drop out of college to focus on gaining practical knowledge and applying it to their various endeavors. As the gap between theoretical knowledge and real-world application continues to be a challenge for students, it becomes essential to examine how effectively college curriculum prepares individuals for the practical demands they will encounter in their professional lives. This chapter provides a comprehensive background on examining the utilization of college curriculum in practical environments. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Universities prioritize the teaching of theories due to their long-standing adherence to traditional practices. Their main emphasis is on publishing research, and their ranking is determined by the quantity of research papers they produce rather than the practical skills imparted to students. Consequently, this selfish motivation leads to a greater emphasis on theoretical knowledge. Lecturers and professors are evaluated and dismissed based on their academic accomplishments rather than their capacity to prepare students for practical job skills. These factors contribute to the perpetuation of the traditional culture of theory-based education in universities. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The acquisition of knowledge and skills in college courses serves as the foundation for individuals' future careers and professional growth. However, the mere acquisition of theoretical knowledge may not suffice in preparing individuals to effectively apply what they have learned in practical settings. There is a growing recognition that the ability to apply college curriculum in real-world contexts is crucial for successful professional performance and career advancement. Therefore, understanding the extent to which college curriculum is utilized in practical environments is vital for improving the educational experience and ensuring its relevance and effectiveness.  
        </p>
        <p>
            In all organizations, the focus is on what an employee can do in their job, rather than just what they know. This emphasizes the importance of applying knowledge in practical situations, rather than simply possessing theoretical knowledge. The world is filled with numerous theories, but not all of them can be put into practice. However, universities often present students with a multitude of both validated and invalidated theories to learn. Thereâ€™s no point in learning a lot of things because the students never use them in the future. In the context of learning and memorization, individuals often rely on memorizing concepts due to time constraints associated with exams. This observation is based on personal experiences and feedback from colleagues. As a result, our focus becomes learning or memorizing for the purpose of passing exams rather than truly understanding the material. Understanding the meaning of a concept is one thing, but being able to apply that concept in real-world scenarios is an entirely different challenge. In the real world, individuals either work for established organizations or establish their own businesses. In both cases, the key requirement is the ability to apply knowledge and skills rather than solely relying on theoretical understanding. 
        </p>
        <p>
            In conducting research, theories are often employed to make new discoveries. However, approved theories are used, and it is important to have a clear understanding of where and how they are applied in the field the research is being conducted. The challenge lies in bridging the gap between theory and practical fields to effectively utilize theories in real-world contexts. The theories themselves are not directly connected to the practical fields, which presents a hurdle in harnessing their full potential in those fields. 
        </p>
        <p>
            In today's dynamic and competitive job market, employers increasingly seek candidates who possess practical skills. They expect graduates to seamlessly transition from the classroom to the workplace, ready to apply their knowledge and contribute meaningfully to their organizations. The utilization of college curriculum in practical environments directly impacts graduates' employability and their ability to meet the expectations of employers. However, this is not the case as the graduates only possess academic qualifications. 
        </p>

        <h3 id="intro2">1.2 Statement of Problem</h3>
        <p>
            The problem addressed in this research is the limited understanding of how college curriculum is applied in practical environments. There is a gap in knowledge regarding how well the knowledge and skills learned in college are used in real-world settings. This disconnects between theory and practice hinders students' readiness for the professional world and can impact their success. To bridge this gap, there is a need to examine how college curriculum is utilized in real-world contexts and identify the factors that affect its application. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Numerous challenges and disconnects exist between academic instruction and practical application. College courses often prioritize theoretical concepts, abstract discussions, and academic assessments, leaving little room for practical hands-on experiences. As a result, students may struggle to translate their theoretical knowledge into practical skills. Moreover, the fast-paced nature of the modern world necessitates a constant update of curriculum to keep up with the evolving needs and demands of various industries. Recognizing these challenges and addressing the disconnects is crucial for educational institutions to better prepare and equip students with the necessary tools for success in practical environments.  
        </p>
        <p>
            When students participate in practical and engaging courses that stimulate their interest and curiosity, one of the primary challenges they face, depression, resulting from an overwhelming workload, can be alleviated. This is because such courses create a more positive and enjoyable learning experience, encouraging students to delve deeper into the subject matter.
