            <h2>4 DATA ANALYSIS & DISCUSSION</h2>

            <h3>4.1 Introduction</h3>
            <p>
                By examining both qualitative and quantitative data, the aim is to understand how effectively the curriculum prepares students for real-world challenges. The analysis provides insights into the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application, offering recommendations for curriculum development and implementation. The discussion highlights key themes and trends, offering meaningful interpretations for stakeholders in the education sector. 
            </p>

                <h4>4.1.1 Quantitative Data </h4>
                <p>
                    In the vast landscape of online platforms that foster engaging discussions, facilitate question-and-answer sessions, and promote the sharing of knowledge on a wide range of topics, numerous notable platforms emerge. These platforms, including the well-known Quora, Reddit, Stack Exchange, Yahoo Answers, as well as prominent social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter, serve as virtual communities where individuals converge to exchange ideas and insights. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    When exploring the conversations unfolding on these online platforms, a prevailing sentiment emerges among the participants: the notion that university courses heavily revolve around theoretical frameworks. Most engagers advocate the view that academic curricula, across various disciplines, tend to prioritize theoretical concepts and academic principles. This prevailing perception highlights the widespread belief within these online communities that higher education institutions place a significant emphasis on imparting theoretical knowledge rather than fostering practical skills applicable in real-world settings. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Within these discussions, the perspectives of different stakeholders come to the forefront. Most students express their perception that the courses they undertake in university often feel disconnected from practical applications in the work field, rendering them somewhat useless. Conversely, approximately half of educators acknowledge the value of these courses, asserting that they provide a foundational understanding that can be applied in professional settings. On the other hand, employees from diverse industries assert that university courses are nearly inconsequential in the work field, as they argue that different skill sets and qualifications are required to thrive in practical environments. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Interestingly, employers from larger agencies and organizations hold a distinct viewpoint. They emphasize that while academic credentials play a role, practical experience and demonstrated abilities hold greater weight in their hiring decisions. Consequently, these employers tend to prioritize candidates who possess hands-on experience, thereby devaluing the theoretical coursework undertaken by students in academic settings. In contrast, employers from smaller companies present a more nuanced perspective. Approximately half of them contend that graduate students perform well in the workplace and meet expectations, implying that the university curriculum plays a significant role in equipping students with the necessary skills.

                    Elon Musk is an employer of robust agencies and has shared various views on the subject matter which is worth highlighting: 
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>
                        ‘A PhD is not required. All that matters is deep understanding in implementation in a way that is useful. Don’t care if you even graduated high school.’ – 
                        <cite>Elon Musk</cite>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        ‘You don’t need a college or high school degree to work at Tesla.’ –
                        <cite>Elon Musk</cite>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        ‘If somebody graduated from a great university, that may be an indication that they will be capable of great things, but it's not necessarily the case. If you look at, say, people like Bill Gates or Larry Ellison, Steve Jobs, these guys didn't graduate from college, but if you had a chance to hire them, of course that would be a good idea. Rather than a degree from a prestigious university, I look for evidence of exceptional ability.’ –
                        <cite>Elon Musk</cite>
                    </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                    The multiplicity of opinions and experiences expressed by various stakeholders across these online platforms underscores the need for comprehensive exploration and analysis of the utilization of college curriculum in practical environments.
