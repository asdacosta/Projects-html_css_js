            <h2 id="conc0">5 CONCLUSION</h2>

            <h3 id="conc1">5.1 Introduction</h3>
            <p>
                The study aimed to investigate the extent to which college curriculum is applied in real-world settings and identify the factors that facilitate or hinder its application. Additionally, it aimed to explore the impact of practical application on students' professional performance and career development. This section presents a summary of the key findings, followed by the conclusion, recommendations, and the contributions of the study. 
            </p>
            <h3 id="conc2">5.2 Summary of Findings</h3>
            <p>
                These are the key findings:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Effectiveness of College Curriculum Application: The research findings indicate that the application of college curriculum in real-world practical settings varies across different stakeholder groups. Students perceive the curriculum as moderately useful, while educators believe it to be more useful in the work field. However, employees and employers express a more critical view, considering it as relatively useless in practical environments. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Factors Facilitating Application: Several factors were identified as facilitating the application of college curriculum in practical environments. These include a strong alignment between theoretical concepts and practical skills, effective instructional methodologies, active collaboration between academia and industry, and opportunities for experiential learning and internships. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Factors Hindering Application: The study also identified several factors that hinder the application of college curriculum in practical environments. These include a lack of updated and industry-relevant curriculum, limited integration of real-world scenarios and projects, inadequate training and professional development for educators, and a gap between academic requirements and industry demands. Another obstacle to students applying university education in the real world is the practice of punishing students for making mistakes, which discourages them from taking risks, approaching new problems, and making bold decisions in professional settings. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Impact on Students' Professional Performance: The findings suggest that practical application of college curriculum positively influences students' professional performance and career development. Students who have opportunities for hands-on experiences and internships tend to develop stronger practical skills, adaptability, and problem-solving abilities, enhancing their employability in the job market. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Enhancement of educational institutions: The study found that integrating real-world experiences and practical applications in the college curriculum, fostering industry partnerships, and adopting learner-centered instructional methods enhance the relevance and effectiveness of college curriculum in preparing students for practical challenges and demands. University education can also be enhanced by promoting the understanding that problems can have multiple solutions. Encouraging students to consider different perspectives and think creatively when faced with challenges allows for a broader range of solutions to be explored, moving beyond a narrow focus on a single solution as it is the case in the university, specifically in examinations. This will enable the students to fit in the practical environment that presents problems which require different ways of solving them. 
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h3 id="conc3">5.3 Conclusion</h3>
            <p>
                Based on the research findings, it can be concluded that while college curriculum has some level of utility in practical environments, there is a need for further improvement and alignment with industry demands. The study highlights the importance of bridging the gap between academia and industry, updating curriculum content, enhancing instructional methodologies, and promoting experiential learning opportunities. 
            </p>

            <h3 id="conc4">5.4 Recommendations</h3>
            <p>
                These are the recommendations based on the research: 
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Curriculum Design and Integration: Educational institutions should revise and update college curriculum to ensure it aligns with current industry needs and includes practical application components. Integration of real-world scenarios, case studies, and projects can enhance the relevance and effectiveness of the curriculum. Educational institutions should also prioritize offering courses that are directly applicable to students' chosen disciplines and avoid borrowing or incorporating courses from unrelated fields. In the courses pertaining to specific disciplines, it is crucial to select and prioritize those that are not only potentially applicable but also will actually be applied in the future. This is important because there are numerous courses that may have applicability but ultimately won't be put into practice.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Professional Development for Educators: Educators should receive ongoing training and professional development opportunities to enhance their understanding of practical industry applications and teaching methodologies that foster practical skills development. They should also adapt teaching methods that suit students’ learning styles.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Collaboration with Industry: Establishing strong partnerships and collaboration between educational institutions and industry stakeholders is crucial. This can facilitate the exchange of knowledge, industry insights, and the development of internships, cooperative education programs, and industry-led projects. For a seamless transition from college to the practical field, it is essential to ensure alignment between the skills provided in the college learning environment and those required in the practical field. Additionally, creating a similarity in the learning setting and the practical setting can facilitate this transition effectively. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Experiential Learning Opportunities: Educational institutions should prioritize the provision of experiential learning opportunities, such as internships, apprenticeships, and industry placements, to allow students to apply their theoretical knowledge in real-world settings. 
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
