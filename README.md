|`flexbox/styles.css`| Stylesheet for `flexbox.html`, all located in `flexbox` directory. Project is built from `InternetingIsHard` and focuses on the topic `Flexbox` in CSS.|

### Files in `core-js` directory.
Most of the JavaScript files are in directories that contain `algorithm.txt` and `file_name.spec.js` which contains the pseudo-code and test conditions correspondingly for the files. 

#### Users
To test a particular condition in a test file, append all other test conditions in it with `.skip` and run:

```shell
npm test file_name.spec.js
```

Running it without any changes to the test file will test all conditions on the JavaScript file and the expected output should be `n passed, n total`. <br>
NB: npm should be installed already and after copying the files, run:

```shell
npm install
```

This will make use of the dependencies `package.json` and `package-lock.json` to set configurations to aid you run the test files.
