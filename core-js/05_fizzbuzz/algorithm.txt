Algorithm
1. Take a number input from user.
2. Print numbers from 1 to user number in the console.
3. In the printed numbers:
     i. If a number is divisible by 3 and 5, replace it with FizzBuzz
     ii. If a number is divisible by 3, replace it with Fizz
     iii. If a number is divisible by 5, replace it with Buzz


Pseudo-code
1. Use parseInt and prompt fxns to take number input.
2. Use for loop to print numbers in console.
3. All results of the if statements should be in console:
     i. Use if, modulus and && operator.
     ii. Use if and modulus.
     iii. Use if and modulus.
