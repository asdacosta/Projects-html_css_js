Problem
A function that takes an array of objects representing people with birth and death year, and returns the oldest person.


Algorithm
1. Create FINDTHEOLDEST fxn with parameter ARR.
    - Let OLDAGE = ARR.reduce of:
        * Obtain difference between birth and death year to get age for each
        * Use comparison operator to compare for each difference
        * Let each current highest be for the accumulator.
    - Use for-loop to M loop over ARR.length - 1.
        * If OLDAGE = any of the difference of birth and death year in array[M], return that object.


Pseudo-code
1.
    FXN findTheOldest(arr)
        LET oldAge = arr.REDUCE((age, obj) => obj.yearOfDeath - obj.yearOfBirth > age, 0);

        FOR (m = 0; m < arr.LENGTH - 1; m++)
            IF (oldAge === arr[m].yearOfDeath - arr[m].yearOfBirth)
                RETURN arr[m];
            END-IF
        END-FOR
    END-FXN
