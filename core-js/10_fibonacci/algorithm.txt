Problem
A function that returns the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence. Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers.


Algorithm
1. Create FIBONACCI fxn with parameter NTH.
    - Initialize FIB as [1, 1].
    - Use for-loop to loop M over NTH - 2.
        * Append summation of previous two characters to FIB.
    - Return the NTH of FIB.


Pseudo-code
1. 
    FXN fibonacci(nth)
        LET fib = [1, 1];
        LET prevSum = 0;
        FOR (m = 0; m < nth - 2; m++)
            prevSum = Sum of two previous elements in array;
            fib.push(prevSum);
        END-FOR
        RETURN fib[nth];
    END-FXN
