Problem
A function that determines whether a given year is a leap year or not.


Algorithm
1. Create LEAPYEARS fxn with YEAR parameter.
    - Create if-statement to check if YEAR is divisible by 4.
        * Nest if-statement to check if YEAR is divisible by 400 or not by 100.
        * Return TRUE.
    - Else return FALSE.


Pseudo-code
1. 
    FXN leapYears(year)
        IF (year is divisible by 4)
            IF (year is divisible by 400 OR year is not divisible by 100)
                RETURN true;
            END-IF
        END-IF
        RETURN false;
    END-FXN
