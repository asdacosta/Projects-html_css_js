Problem
A function that determines whether a given year is a leap year or not.


Algorithm
1. Create LEAPYEARS fxn with YEAR parameter.
    - Create if-statement to check if YEAR is divisible by 4.
        * Nest if-statement to check if YEAR is divisible by 400.


Pseudo-code
1. 
    FXN leapYears(year)
        IF (year is divisible by 4)
            IF (year is divisible by 400)
                RETURN true;
            ELSE 
                RETURN false;
            END-IF
        END-IF
    END-FXN
